# 🌊 Depth-Mapping 🌏

🚀 This project leverages **computer vision** to perform depth analysis and index mapping, enabling enhanced depth perception and visualization in images.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This system performs two key tasks:
1. **Depth Map Generation**: Uses advanced image processing techniques to compute and visualize depth information from images.
2. **Index Mapping for Depth Analysis**: Implements a structured index mapping approach to categorize and analyze different depth regions within an image.

This project is useful for applications in **3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and medical imaging**.

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Depth Map Computation** 🌊
   - Utilizes stereo vision techniques or precomputed disparity maps to derive depth information.
   - Measures depth maps from two images of the same object taken from different angles.
   - Visualizes depth variations using color-coded mapping.

2. **Index Mapping for Depth Segmentation** 🔍
   - Utilizes Mask R-CNN trained on the COCO dataset to perform masking or mapping index tasks.
   - Segments depth regions based on computed depth values.
   - Assign structured indices to different depth layers for enhanced visualization and analysis.
